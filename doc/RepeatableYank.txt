DESCRIPTION					  *RepeatableYank-description*

Text fragments can be collected and accumulated by first yanking into a
lowercase register, and then subsequently yanking into the uppercase variant.
The problem is that the register must be specified on every yank command, and
one accidental omission of uppercasing the register results in the
irrecoverable loss of all fragments collected so far.

This can be somewhat remedied by enabling the non-default |cpo-y| setting,
which allows a repeat of a yank (plus remembered last register) via |.|

This plugin instead offers an alternative yank command |gy|, which allows to
specify the accumulator register only once on its initial use, can then be
repeated as an operator, linewise, in visual mode and via |.|, and enhances
some yank semantics for special cases.  For example, subsequent blockwise
yanks are merged as blocks to the right, instead of added below the existing
text blocks.

==============================================================================
USAGE							*RepeatableYank-usage*
							     *gy* *gyy* *v_gy*
["x]gy{motion}		Yank {motion} text into register x.
["x][count]gyy		Yank [count] lines into register x.
{Visual}["x]gy		Yank the selected text into register x.

			Subsequent gy commands without an explicit register
			and command repeats via |.| will append (in the case
			of named registers {a-zA-Z}) the text to / overwrite
			(for registers {0-9*+~/-}) the previously used
			register x, until another register is explicitly
			given.
			Therefore, you can gradually build up text in a named
			register, or easily update the system clipboard
			without having to repeat the register on every yank.

EXAMPLE						      *RepeatableYank-example*

Start by yanking "an entire line" into register a: >
    "agyy
<   an entire line ~

Add "another line" to the same register a without specifying it again: >
    gyy
<   an entire line ~
    another line ~

Add "word1" and "word2"; even though the register is now of linewise type,
these are added on a single line: >
    gyw w.
<   an entire line ~
    another line ~
    word1 word2 ~

Now, let's yank a vertical block of "ABC" into another register: >
    <C-V>2j "bgy
<   A ~
    B ~
    C ~

Another vertical block of "123" is appended blockwise to the right: >
    l1v.
<   A1 ~
    B2 ~
    C3 ~

You can build up multiple registers in parallel. To switch to another register
without starting over, just specify the uppercase register name: >
    "Agyy
<   an entire line ~
    another line ~
    word1 word2 ~
    +addition after register switch ~

INSTALLATION					 *RepeatableYank-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim RepeatableYank*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					 *RepeatableYank-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- repeat.vim (vimscript #2136) plugin (optional).
- visualrepeat.vim (vimscript #3848) plugin (optional).

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					*RepeatableYank-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

					    *g:RepeatableYank_DefaultRegister*
Since you don't need this plugin to repeat yanks to the unnamed register (just
use the built-in |y|), register "a is used as the default register, i.e. when
you use |gy| for the first time without explicitly specifying a register. To
change this default to another register (e.g. the clipboard), use: >
    let g:RepeatableYank_DefaultRegister = '+'
<
